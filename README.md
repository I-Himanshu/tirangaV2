I made this  amazing animated "TriColour" with the help of venilla javascript and Canvas ..

I know this gonna blow your mind 😉...

And most important thing if you think you can modify this amazing flag..Sure you can go for that..

First you have to create an issue reading what you want to change in my project and then fork my project ...

    #All the best guys..👍
