## About My Project

I made this  amazing animated "TriColour" with the help of venilla javascript and Canvas ..

This project is a random thought. It has a simple plane ui that shows the Indian National flag through a random particle animation. It has many features that shows the diffraction between the particles. 
The greater time you hold the screen the greater randomness will shallow. It has a beautiful colour combinations having some written texts. 
The Chakra of the flag also blink regularly and this gives a soothing experience. 

Let's run this code on your pc or smart phone...
